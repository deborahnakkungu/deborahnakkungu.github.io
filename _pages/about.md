I am an incoming PhD student at [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/), Cornell University, in the economics track within the [Department of Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/). I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics from CUNY Hunter College.  My CV is available [here](https://deborahnakkungu.github.io/files/Deborah_CV.pdf).

I co-founded [Youth Plus Uganda](https://ypec.netlify.app/), an organization dedicated to enhancing the health and well-being of young people, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality, and economic empowerment. 

My research interests lie in the fields of Development Economics, Health Economics and policy. I study development issues impacting developing countries and explore policies designed to address them.
