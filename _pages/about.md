I am a PhD student at [Jeb E. Brooks School of Public Policy](https://publicpolicy.cornell.edu/), Cornell University, specializing in the economics track within the [Department of Economics](https://economics.cornell.edu/). I hold a Masterâ€™s degree in Economics from CUNY Hunter College.

I co-founded [Youth Plus Uganda](https://ypec.netlify.app/), an organization dedicated to enhancing the health and well-being of young people, with a focus on sexual and reproductive health, gender equality, and economic empowerment. Our approach utilizes peer-to-peer education to empower young individuals, advocate for their needs, and foster partnerships with authorities and local health centers.

My research interests lie in Development Economics and Health Economics. I study development issues impacting developing countries and explore policies designed to address these challenges.
